# MetaMorph

**Transform your metadata. Transform your models.**

MetaMorph is an open-source framework that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process, extract, and transform messy, unstructured, or heterogeneous columns of metadata into structured, machine-readable formats to enhance machine learning pipelines and predictive models across any domain.

## 🚀 Why MetaMorph?

High-quality metadata is the backbone of meaningful machine learning. However, real-world metadata often lives in free-text columns, inconsistent formats, or sparsely documented structures, making it difficult to incorporate in predictive workflows.

**MetaMorph solves this by:**
- Parsing free-text and semi-structured metadata using LLMs.
- Standardizing and normalizing metadata fields automatically.
- Extracting domain-relevant entities and numerical values.
- Generating machine-readable feature columns for ML models.
- Documenting and flagging uncertainties or ambiguities in metadata.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Plug-and-play**: Drop in your dataset and get structured outputs ready for ML.  
✅ **Domain-agnostic**: Works for biomedical, materials, environmental, clinical, and industrial datasets.  
✅ **LLM-powered**: Uses state-of-the-art open-weight or API LLMs for extraction and structuring.  
✅ **Extensible**: Add your domain-specific dictionaries, ontologies, or constraints easily.  
✅ **Open-source**: Built to benefit the research and ML community.
